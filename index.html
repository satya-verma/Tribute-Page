                In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student
                who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics. After
                completing
                his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend
                Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he
                graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras
                Institute of Technology. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was
                dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was
                finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him,
                "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline". He narrowly missed
                achieving
                his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were
                available
                in the IAF.

                After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation
                (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the
                Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS) In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space
                Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch
                Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980.
                In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, Goddard Space
                Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Kalam served as the Chief
                Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development
                Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during
                this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role.
                Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential
                election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal.
                His term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007.

                On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth"
                at the
                Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some
                discomfort, but
                was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest, At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his
                lecture,
                he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he
                lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was
                confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST. His last words, to his aide
                Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"
